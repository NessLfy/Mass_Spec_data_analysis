Standard portein:

-assignment , masses and conclude the stoichiometry for the different concentration tested at the same condition

-> conclusion effect of concentration (X)

- assignment masses and stoichiometry of the different trap voltages 

-> conclusion related to the effect of the CE voltage on the spectra (X)

LukE :

-assignment , masses and conclude the stoichiometry 

-> conclusion related to the state (conformation, hydrolysis, adducts,etc ) of the protein if present (X)

-assignment , masses and conclude the stoichiometry of protein +ligend

-> Do you see binding, how many binding site per protein what is the mass of the ligand ? (X)
